            <h2><em>LIFE FITNESS AND HEALTH</em></h2>
            <p>
                Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely absence of disease. Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations, and daily activities.
                Fitness encompasses a holistic approach to maintaining physical health through a variety of exercises and lifestyle choices.
                Tailoring your fitness plan to your personal goals, preferences, and physical condition will help you stay motivated and achieve the best results!

                        <p>A cardio workout is designed to elevate your heart rate, improve cardiovascular health, and burn calories. It typically starts with a warm-up of light aerobic exercises to prepare the body. The main workout may include high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for a powerful calorie burn or steady-state cardio like running, cycling, or swimming for sustained heart rate elevation. The session ends with a cool-down to gradually lower the heart rate and stretching to enhance flexibility. This routine boosts endurance, supports weight management, and strengthens the heart.</p>

                        <p>A strength workout focuses on building muscle, increasing strength, and improving overall body composition. It typically involves resistance exercises using body weight, free weights, machines, or resistance bands. A session often begins with a warm-up to prepare the muscles and joints, followed by exercises targeting major muscle groups like the chest, back, legs, and core. The workout might include sets of compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows, along with isolation exercises for specific muscles.</p>

It typically involves a series of stretching exercises that target different muscle groups. The workout usually begins with a light warm-up to increase blood flow to the muscles, making them more pliable for stretching.</p>
